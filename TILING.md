# Tiling window managers vs stacking window managers
Using a tiling window manager (TWM) over a stacking window manager (SWM) has several benefits, particularly for users who want more control over their desktop environment and prioritize efficiency. Here’s why you might choose a tiling window manager:

### 1. **Efficient Use of Screen Real Estate**
   - **Tiling window managers** automatically arrange windows side-by-side, maximizing the use of available screen space. This eliminates wasted space (such as gaps between windows or areas taken up by window borders and title bars), which is especially beneficial if you're working with multiple windows at once (e.g., coding, browsing, or document editing).
   - **Stacking window managers**, on the other hand, have windows overlapping, which can create inefficiencies, especially when working with many open applications. You often have to manually resize or move windows to fit them on the screen.

### 2. **Reduced Window Management Overhead**
   - In a tiling WM, windows are arranged in a predefined layout (e.g., vertical, horizontal, grids), and you don't have to manually resize or position them, which saves time and energy.
   - In a stacking WM, you need to manage window positioning and resizing yourself, or rely on features like window snapping to make things more manageable, which can be more tedious.

### 3. **Increased Focus and Less Distraction**
   - Tiling window managers promote a "single-purpose" mentality by organizing windows in a way that helps focus on a single task at a time. The clutter is reduced, and since windows do not overlap, it becomes easier to switch between tasks without getting distracted by non-visible windows.
   - In stacking window managers, there’s often a risk of background windows being lost behind others, which can lead to unnecessary distraction and interruptions in your workflow.

### 4. **Improved Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tiling window managers are usually highly optimized for keyboard control. You can easily switch between windows, resize them, or change layouts using keyboard shortcuts, which enhances productivity and reduces reliance on the mouse.
   - With stacking WMs, while you can use keyboard shortcuts, it’s typically less intuitive or less efficient because you're often constrained by the physical position and size of the windows.

### 5. **Better for Multi-Monitor Setups**
   - Tiling window managers handle multiple monitors seamlessly by allowing you to control how windows are distributed across different screens without manual intervention. They often provide a more uniform and efficient way of managing windows on multiple displays.
   - Stacking window managers can be less effective in multi-monitor setups, as window positioning and resizing across screens might need to be done manually or with additional configuration.

### 6. **Less System Resource Usage**
   - Tiling WMs, by design, tend to be lightweight and efficient. They don’t need to render complex window decorations (e.g., title bars, borders) and other graphical elements that stacking WMs often do. This can result in less memory and CPU usage, especially beneficial on lower-end hardware.
   - Stacking window managers often come with more visual features and effects (like window shadows, animations, and transparency), which can require more system resources.

### 7. **More Control Over the Layout**
   - Tiling window managers allow for a high degree of customization and control over window layout. You can adjust layouts on the fly, create custom window arrangements, or split windows in various ways to suit your workflow.
   - In stacking WMs, while customization is possible, you're often limited to adjusting the size and position of windows manually, which can be less fluid and responsive than the automated tiling approach.

### 8. **Consistency and Predictability**
   - Tiling window managers often have consistent layouts that adapt as you open and close windows, ensuring that your workspace is always organized in a predictable way.
   - Stacking window managers can become chaotic as windows overlap, making it difficult to keep track of your workspace if you have too many open windows.

### 9. **Learning Curve and Minimalism**
   - Tiling window managers are often seen as "minimalist" because they strip away much of the visual clutter, focusing on efficiency and productivity. While there is a steeper learning curve in terms of getting used to keyboard-driven navigation and configuration, this can lead to a more rewarding and productive user experience once mastered.
   - Stacking window managers can be more intuitive for beginners because they resemble the default behavior of desktop environments (with overlapping windows), but they can lack the fine-grained control offered by tiling managers.

### 10. **Ideal for Power Users**
   - Tiling window managers are particularly favored by power users, programmers, system administrators, and those who work with many applications at once (like terminals, text editors, web browsers, etc.). They encourage a fast, keyboard-centric workflow and are highly customizable.
   - For users who are looking for a more visual or graphical desktop experience, a stacking window manager may be preferred, as it mimics traditional desktop environments where windows overlap and are managed visually.

### Common Examples of Tiling Window Managers:
- **i3**
- **AwesomeWM**
- **Xmonad**
- **Sway** (Wayland-based)
- **dwm**
- **bspwm**

### Common Examples of Stacking Window Managers:
- **Openbox**
- **Fluxbox**
- **Metacity**
- **Mutter**
- **Compiz** (although it can be configured for tiling as well)

### Conclusion
If you prioritize efficiency, keyboard control, and minimalism, a tiling window manager might be the right choice. It forces you to be more organized and helps you get more out of your screen space. However, if you prefer a more visual, less structured environment where windows behave in a more traditional manner, a stacking window manager could be a better fit. Ultimately, the best choice depends on your workflow, personal preferences, and what you value most in a desktop environment.
