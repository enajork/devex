# Xorg vs Wayland

While **Wayland** is often seen as the future of Linux graphical systems due to its more modern architecture and security features, **Xorg** (the X Window System) still has a number of reasons to be used over Wayland, particularly for certain use cases or environments. Here are some key reasons why you might choose to stick with **Xorg** rather than switch to Wayland:

### 1. **Mature Ecosystem and Compatibility**
   - **Xorg** has been around for decades (since the 1980s), which has led to a rich ecosystem of tools, drivers, and applications designed specifically for it. Because of this, Xorg tends to have much broader compatibility with various hardware and software out of the box.
   - **Wayland**, though improving, is a newer protocol and has fewer applications and utilities directly supporting it. Many programs and drivers are still tailored primarily to Xorg.

### 2. **Better Compatibility with Legacy Software**
   - Some older applications, especially those that rely on specific X11 features (like certain window managers, remote desktop tools, or older graphical apps), may not work properly or at all under Wayland. While **XWayland** allows X11 applications to run on Wayland, this compatibility layer isn't always perfect, and some applications may experience glitches, lag, or missing functionality.
   - In contrast, **Xorg** is universally compatible with both modern and older applications without the need for translation layers.

### 3. **Greater Support for Remote Access and X11 Features**
   - **Xorg** has strong support for remote access via protocols like **X11 forwarding** (through SSH), VNC, or **XDMCP** (X Display Manager Control Protocol). This makes it a go-to solution for remote server management or for users who need to run graphical applications over a network.
   - **Wayland**, on the other hand, was designed with local usage in mind and doesn't support these remote access features as seamlessly. Although solutions like **Waypipe** and **RDP** have emerged for remote use on Wayland, they are still in their infancy and do not provide the same level of performance or robustness as Xorg-based solutions.

### 4. **Customizability and Flexibility**
   - **Xorg** is known for its extreme customizability. You can tweak nearly every aspect of the X11 server through configuration files, such as `xorg.conf`, and use **X resources** to fine-tune window behavior, input devices, keybindings, and more.
   - While **Wayland** supports a degree of configuration, it's generally more restricted, especially when it comes to low-level adjustments. For example, changing how input devices behave, fine-tuning display setups, or tweaking window management features is more flexible in Xorg.

### 5. **Established Support for Window Managers and Desktop Environments**
   - **Xorg** has strong support for traditional **window managers** (e.g., i3, Openbox, Xmonad) and **desktop environments** (e.g., GNOME, KDE Plasma). These environments are often deeply integrated with X11-specific features (like X11's input handling or window compositing), meaning they can sometimes provide a more polished experience on Xorg.
   - **Wayland** support for some of these desktop environments is still in progress. For example, **GNOME** and **KDE** both have Wayland support, but some features (like screen tearing, multi-monitor configurations, or specific window behaviors) might not work as well as they do in Xorg. Wayland's compositors, like **Weston** or **Sway**, are gaining traction, but they are still newer and may lack some features present in X-based environments.

### 6. **Support for Older Hardware**
   - Because **Xorg** is so well-established, it generally has better support for older hardware and legacy graphics drivers. Many older graphics cards or chips are only properly supported by the **Xorg** drivers, especially for 2D or OpenGL acceleration.
   - **Wayland** requires newer drivers that are often more tightly integrated with the kernel and Mesa, meaning older hardware may not receive the same level of support, or may face issues like graphical glitches or poor performance.

### 7. **Fewer Restrictions on Display Servers**
   - **Xorg** is the backend for various display servers, meaning you can run different compositors or window managers that are fully compatible with X. There's a wide range of **X-based compositors** like **i3**, **Openbox**, and **awesomeWM** that allow fine-tuned control over window management.
   - With **Wayland**, you're more restricted to specific compositors (like **Weston**, **Sway**, or **Gnome Shell** for Wayland), as each compositor has to implement its own Wayland protocol. This can limit your choices if you're someone who prefers a very specific type of window management or behavior.

### 8. **Support for More Input Devices and Drivers**
   - **Xorg** generally offers better support for a wide variety of input devices, including older hardware, touchscreen devices, or specialized input peripherals (e.g., drawing tablets, older mice, or joystick/gamepad devices). This support is crucial for users who work with specialized hardware.
   - **Wayland**'s input device support is steadily improving but is often not as comprehensive as Xorg's, especially with more obscure or niche peripherals.

### 9. **Graphics Features (For Some Users)**
   - **Xorg** is more mature in terms of integrating with legacy graphics technologies like **XRender** and **Xv**, which may still be necessary for some users, particularly in multimedia or video applications. Even though Wayland supports modern GPU technologies (like **GBM** and **KMS**), users relying on older graphics stacks may experience issues when moving to Wayland.

### 10. **Stability and Reliability**
   - **Xorg**, being a more mature system, tends to be more stable and predictable in terms of performance. There are fewer surprises with compatibility and bugs, especially with well-established distributions or hardware.
   - **Wayland** is still evolving, and although it has made tremendous progress, there are still occasional regressions, instability, or missing features, depending on the compositor, distribution, or hardware.

### 11. **Specific Use Cases: Gaming and Screen Recording**
   - While **Wayland** has made strides in gaming, especially with technologies like **PipeWire** and **VRR** support, **Xorg** still has better support for certain use cases, like screen recording with tools like **OBS** or **X11 capture**.
   - Many gaming tools, including some emulators or game launchers, may also have better compatibility with Xorg due to the protocol’s longer history in the gaming ecosystem.

### Conclusion: When to Stick with Xorg
You might want to use **Xorg** instead of **Wayland** in the following situations:
- If you need **better hardware compatibility**, especially with older graphics cards.
- If you're using **remote desktop tools** (like X11 forwarding, VNC, or XDMCP).
- If you're running **legacy or niche software** that depends on X11 features.
- If you need a **high degree of customization** over your graphical environment.
- If you use a **specific window manager** or **desktop environment** that works best with Xorg.
- If you're working with **older input devices** (e.g., touchscreens, drawing tablets) that may not be fully supported under Wayland.

In short, Xorg remains a solid, dependable choice for users who value stability, compatibility, and configurability. If you’re already happy with your current setup, and don’t see immediate benefits from Wayland, Xorg might be the better option for now. However, Wayland is actively developing, and for many users, it may eventually replace Xorg as the default choice once it matures further.
